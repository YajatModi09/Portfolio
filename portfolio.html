                    <h3>Calculator</h3>
                    <pre>Project Description: Web-based Calculator
                        
                        The web-based calculator project aims to create a functional and interactive calculator using HTML for structure, 
                        CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
                        
                        Key Features:
                        
                        1. Basic Arithmetic Operations:The calculator supports essential operations such as addition, subtraction, 
                        multiplication, and division.
                        
                        2. Responsive Design: The calculator is designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes and orientations, 
                        ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
                        
                        3. Memory Functions: Additional functionalities include memory operations (memory store, recall, clear) to facilitate 
                        multiple-step calculations.
                        
                        4. Clear and Intuitive Interface: The user interface is clean and intuitive, with large buttons for digits and operations,
                        ensuring ease of use for users of all ages.
                        
                        Technologies Used:
                        
                        - HTML: Used for structuring the calculator layout and components.
                          
                        - CSS: Employed for styling the calculator interface, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
                          
                        - JavaScript: Utilized for implementing the calculator's logic and functionality, including arithmetic operations, input 
                        handling, and error management.
                        
                        Project Goals:
                        
                        The primary goal of this project is to develop a fully functional and visually appealing web-based calculator that meets 
                        the following criteria:
                          
                        - Functionality: Provide accurate arithmetic calculations with support for common operations.
                          
                        - User Experience: Create an intuitive and responsive user interface that enhances usability and accessibility.
                          
                        - Performance: Ensure efficient performance with smooth operation and minimal latency.
                        
                        Future Enhancements:
                        
                        Future iterations of the project could include advanced functionalities such as scientific calculations (trigonometric 
                        functions, exponentiation), support for more complex expressions (handling parentheses and precedence), and integration 
                        with external APIs for additional features.
                        
                        By completing this project, the objective is to demonstrate proficiency in front-end web development technologies (HTML,
                        CSS, JavaScript) and practical implementation of interactive user interfaces.
